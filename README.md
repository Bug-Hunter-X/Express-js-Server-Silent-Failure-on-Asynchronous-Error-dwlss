This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Node.js Express.js applications: silent failure due to unhandled exceptions within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file shows a server that might throw an error during an asynchronous request. The problem is that the error is caught but not properly handled, causing the server to stop responding to client requests without sending an error response. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue by sending a proper error response to the client even when an error occurs.
